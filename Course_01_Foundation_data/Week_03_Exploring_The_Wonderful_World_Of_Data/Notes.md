## Self-Reflection: Collecting data

### Question:

You are interviewing for a data analyst role at a local ice cream company. They are interested in using data on customer ice cream flavor preferences to help drive important decisions.

The hiring manager asks you:

“We want to better understand our customers’ ice cream flavor preferences, but honestly we don’t even know where to start. How you would approach this if you were part of our team?”

&nbsp;

### Answer:

I think the first step is creating a questionnaire that allows the ice cream shop can get the data they are looking for after people answer the questionnaire. The best way to get this question is to survey people and ask for their preferences. As a small business, I think I will store the data in the spreadsheet. Then, I will use Excel to analyze the result. I will save the data on a hard drive and destroy it when I have newer data.

Thank you for the submission!
Understanding the life cycle of the data you’re working with is crucial to any project. Your response should focus on helping the ice cream company come up with specific answers to the questions associated with each step of the data life cycle.

To use their data successfully:

- The ice cream company must first figure out what data they need and where they can get it.
- Once they have the data, they have to be sure of what they will (and won’t) use it for.
- The ice cream company also has to be mindful of how they will keep the data secure, and how to deal with old data that has outlived its usefulness.

As a data analyst, these are the types of questions you should always be seeking to answer about your data.
