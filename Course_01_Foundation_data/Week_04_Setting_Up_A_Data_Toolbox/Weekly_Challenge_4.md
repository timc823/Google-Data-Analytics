```
SELECT *
```

&nbsp;

### Question 6

When writing a query, what word does a data analyst use to indicate the table from which the data will be retrieved?

### Question 7

You are writing a query that asks a database to retrieve data about the customer with identification number 244. The column name for customer identification numbers is customer_id. What is the correct SQL clause?

- **WHERE customer_id = 244**
- WHERE_customer_id=244
