### Question 3
A data analyst uses the COUNTIF function to count the number of times a value less than 5 occurs between spreadsheet cells A2 through A100. What is the correct syntax? Type your answer below.

* =COUNTIF(A2:A100,<5)
* **=COUNTIF(A2:A100,"<5")**
* =COUNTIF(A2:A100,">5")
* =COUNTIF(A2:A100,>5)

> The correct syntax is =COUNTIF(A2:A100,"<5"). COUNTIF will return the number of cells that match a value. A2:A100 is the range. And “<5” is the specified value.
