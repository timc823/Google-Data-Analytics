# SQL dialects and their uses

In this reading, you will learn more about SQL dialects and some of their different uses. As a quick refresher, **Structured Query Language**, or SQL, is a language used to talk to databases. Learning SQL can be a lot like learning a new language-- including the fact that languages usually have different dialects within them. Some database products have their own variant of SQL, and these different varieties of SQL dialects are what help you communicate with each database product.

These dialects will be different from company to company and might change over time if the company moves to another database system. So, a lot of analysts start with Standard SQL and then adjust the dialect they use based on what database they are working with. As a junior data analyst, it is important to know that there are slight differences between dialects. But by mastering Standard SQL, which is the dialect you will be working with in this program, you will be prepared to use SQL in any database.
