### Question 1
What is the goal of the analysis phase of the data analysis process?

* To make generalizations about data
* **To identify trends and relationships in data**
* To describe data structures
* To generate new data


> In the data analysis process, the goal of analysis is to identify trends and relationships within that data so you can accurately answer the question you’re asking. 

&nbsp;

### Question 2
During which phase of analysis can you find a correlation between two variables?

* **Transform data**
* Organize data 
* Get input from others
* Format and adjust data


> Finding a correlation between two variables occurs while transforming data.

&nbsp;

### Question 3
A data analyst is working on a dataset and begins the transform data phase of analysis. What are some of the actions that they will take? Select all that apply.

* Filtering data
* Sorting data
* **Finding a correlation in data**
* **Performing a calculation with data**

> A data analyst in the transform data phase of analysis identifies relationships and patterns between data. This includes finding correlations and performing calculations on the data.

&nbsp;

### Question 4
Typically, a data analyst uses filters when they want to expand the amount of data they are working with.

* True
* **False**

> Typically, a data analyst uses filters when they want to narrow down the amount of data they are working with. 

&nbsp;

### Question 5
A data analyst is sorting spreadsheet data. They want to make sure that, when they rearrange the data, data across rows is kept together. What technique should they use to sort the data?

* Sort Rows
* **Sort Sheet**
* Sort Together
* Sort Column


> Sort sheet sorts all of the data in a spreadsheet by a specific sorted column. Data across rows is kept together during the sort.

&nbsp; 

### Question 6
A data analyst sorts a spreadsheet range between cells F19 and G82. They sort in ascending order by the second column, Column G. What is the syntax they are using?

* =SORT(F19:G82, B, TRUE)
* =SORT(F19:G82, B, FALSE)
* =SORT(F19:G82, 2, FALSE)
* **=SORT(F19:G82, 2, TRUE)**

&nbsp;

> The  syntax is =SORT(F19:G82, 2, TRUE). The first part of the function sorts the data in the specified range. The 2 represents the second column. And a TRUE statement sorts in ascending order.

### Question 7
You are working with data about coffee beans from a roasting company. You only want to review data that corresponds to a specific blend of hazelnut coffee beans. Which of the following sections of a SQL statement would return the  result?

* ORDER BY Bean = “hazelnut”
* ORDER BY “hazelnut”
* WHERE “hazelnut”
* **WHERE Bean = “hazelnut”**


> The  statement is WHERE Bean = “hazelnut”. A WHERE statement in SQL includes the name of the column, an equals sign, and the value(s) in the column you want to include.

&nbsp;

### Question 8
A data analyst works for a cooking magazine. They want to remove recipes from their website that are unpopular with readers. Readers rate their recipes with stars. The more stars, the more popular the recipe. Which section of a SQL query will return the soup recipes with the lowest star ratings at the top?

* WHERE Cuisine = "Soup" ORDER BY Rating DESC
* WHERE Cuisine = "Soup" ORDER BY DESC
* **WHERE Cuisine = "Soup" ORDER BY Rating** 
* WHERE Cuisine = "Soup" ORDER BY ASC


> The  section of a SQL query is WHERE Cuisine = "Soup" ORDER BY Rating. It will return soup recipes with the lowest star ratings at the top. The ORDER BY function orders results in ascending order by default.
