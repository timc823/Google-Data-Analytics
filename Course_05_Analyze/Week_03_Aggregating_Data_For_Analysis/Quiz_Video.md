### Video: Preparing for VLOOKUP

A data analyst applies the VALUE function to a text string that represents a number, but is formatted as text. What does the VALUE function do to that text string?

* It changes the value of the text string to zero.
* **It converts the text string to a numerical value.**
* It filters any text strings in the spreadsheet that equal the value.
* It searches for text strings within the spreadsheet that match the value.

> The VALUE function converts the text string to a numerical value.

### Video: Identifying common VLOOKUP errors

VLOOKUP has certain limitations. One limitation is that it only returns the first match it finds within the specified range. Another limitation is that VLOOKUP can only search through the first column in a spreadsheet.


* True
* **False**

> VLOOKUP only returns the first match it finds within a specified range and can only search in columns to the right.


In the function =VLOOKUP(K2,'Sheet 4'!A:B,2,TRUE), what does the word TRUE indicate?

* TRUE tells VLOOKUP to search for exact matches.
* **TRUE tells VLOOKUP to search for approximate matches.**
* TRUE tells VLOOKUP to start at the top of the specified range. 
* TRUE tells VLOOKUP to search for as many matches as it can find in the specified range.

> In the function =VLOOKUP(K2,'Sheet 4'!A:B,2,TRUE), TRUE tells VLOOKUP to search for approximate matches.

### Video: Understanding JOINS

A data analyst wants to combine rows from four tables in a database. Which SQL clause combines two or more tables based on a related column?

* LINK
* MERGE
* **JOIN**
* CONNECT

> JOIN is a SQL clause that combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column. 

A data analyst is working with two tables in a database. Which JOIN clause will enable them to combine RIGHT and LEFT JOIN in order to return all matching records in both tables?

* **OUTER**
* ALL
* MATCH
* INNER

> The OUTER JOIN clause will enable them to combine RIGHT and LEFT JOIN in order to return all matching records in both tables.

### Video: COUNT and COUNT DISTINCT

What is the key difference between COUNT and COUNT DISTINCT in a database query?

COUNT returns the number of values in a specified range. COUNT DISTINCT returns all values in a specified range. 
COUNT returns the total values in a specified range. COUNT DISTINCT returns the number of rows in a specified range. 
**COUNT returns the number of rows in a specified range. COUNT DISTINCT only returns the distinct values in a specified range.**
COUNT returns the number of columns in a specified range. COUNT DISTINCT only returns the distinct values within those columns. 

> COUNT returns the number of rows in a specified range. COUNT DISTINCT only returns the distinct values in a specified range.
