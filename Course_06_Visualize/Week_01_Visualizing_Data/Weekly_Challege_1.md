A data analyst wants to create a visualization that demonstrates how often data values fall into certain ranges. What type of data visualization should they use?

* Scatter plot
* **Histogram**
* Correlation chart
* Line graph

### Question 2

A data analyst notices that two variables in their data seem to rise and fall at the same time. They recognize that these variables are related somehow. What is this an example of?

* Causation
* Tabulation
* Visualization

* **Ideate**
* Test
* Prototype
* Define

> This describes the ideate phase. There are five phases of the design process: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test. The ideate phase is when you start to generate your data visualization ideas.

### Question 7

Fill in the blank: A data analyst can make their visualizations more accessible by adding _____, which are text explanations placed directly on the visualizations.

* legends
* callouts
* **labels**
* subheadings

> A data analyst can make their visualizations more accessible by adding labels, which are text explanations placed directly on the visualizations. Labeling data directly instead of relying on legends can make data visualizations more accessible.

### Question 8

A data analyst is making their data visualization more accessible. They separate the background and the foreground of the visualization using bright, contrasting colors. What does this describe?

* **Distinguishing**
* Text alternatives
* Text-based format
* Labelling
