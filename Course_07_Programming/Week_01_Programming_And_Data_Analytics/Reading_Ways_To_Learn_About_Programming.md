## Tips for learning programming languages
Here are a few tips to follow when you start learning a new programming language:

* Define a practice project and use the language to help you complete it. This makes the learning process more practical and engaging.  
* Keep previous concepts and coding principles in mind. Many of these are transferable between programming languages. So, after you have learned one language, learning a second or third programming language tends to be much easier. 
* Create and keep good notes and cheat sheets in whatever format (handwritten or typed) that works best for you.
* Create an online filing system for information that you can easily access while you work in various programming environments.
