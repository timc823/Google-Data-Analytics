## L3 Cleaning data

&nbsp;

### Question 1

A data analyst is cleaning their data in R. They want to be sure that their column names are unique and consistent to avoid any errors in their analysis. What R function can they use to do this automatically?

* rename()
* select()
* rename_with()
* **clean_names()**

> The clean_names() function will automatically make sure that column names are unique and consistent.

### Question 2

A data analyst is trying to sort the penguins bill_length_mm data in descending order. They input the following code: 

`penguins %>%`

What code does the analyst add to organize the column *bill_length_mm* in descending order?

* **`arrange(-bill_length_mm)`**
* `arrange(=bill_length_mm)`
* `arrange(+bill_length_mm)`
* `arrange(%>%bill_length_mm)`

> You add the code chunk **`arrange(bill_length_mm)`** to sort the column bill_length_mm in ascending order. The correct code is **`penguins %>% arrange(bill_length_mm)`**. Inside the parentheses of the arrange() function is the name of the variable you want to sort. The code returns a tibble that displays the data for bill_length_mm from shortest to longest. The shortest bill length is 32.1mm.

* **unite()**
* arrange()
* select()

> The unite() function can be used to combine columns.
