# The interview process

For data analyst positions, you can think of the job interview process as having four stages: introduction, skill test, compatibility, and decision making. Let’s take a closer look at each of these stages.

&nbsp;

**Stage 1: Introduction (resume and portfolio)**

The goal of the introductory interview is for the recruiter to get to know you. Their goal is to find out who you are and assess your background. This is your chance to shine. Have your portfolio and resume ready and be prepared to speak concisely about your qualifications, experience, and skills using specific examples from both.

**Stage 2: The skill test interview (case study)**

This is usually your second interview and it will often be conducted by a fellow data analyst or data engineer. In this interview, you will be given a technical assessment that will consist of testing your SQL and programming skills. You will also be asked to complete a case study or a behavioral test. Your potential employer wants to know if you can do the job that you are interviewing for and they will be focused on getting you to demonstrate your skills. Make sure you are prepared with well-formed answers and highlight your technical knowledge and problem-solving skills.

**Stage 3: The compatibility interview (optional)**

In some cases, not all, there will be an additional interview to determine mutual compatibility between you and the company. To give you a comprehensive idea of what the work culture is like, the interviewer might include other members of the team during this round.

Often the goal here is to determine if you are a good fit with the rest of the team that you will be working with. This might include individuals who will be your peers as well as the person you might be reporting to. As with the introductory interview, get ready to discuss yourself more in depth, using examples from your portfolio and resume as needed.

**Stage 4: Decision-making**

Once your last interview concludes, it is advisable to ask about next steps as well as a timeline of when a hiring decision will be made. Take note that the process can take anywhere from 4 to 6 weeks as things get finalized and all other interviews are wrapped up. 

You can receive one of three responses: an offer letter, a rejection letter, or no communication. Receiving a job offer is very exciting and something you can take pride in. However, don’t feel pressured or obligated to accept the first offer you are presented. Feel free to ask for time to consider, do your research on a fair salary or benefits package, and be open-minded and willing to compromise.

## Build your network

Unfortunately, there are times when you will receive a rejection and despite any disappointments you may have, responding back with a thoughtful email will create a professional relationship with that hiring manager or company. You may even stand out in a way that might benefit your career in the long run.

There will even be cases where you will receive no response from the hiring manager. This doesn’t necessarily mean you did not get the position and sending an inquiring follow-up email will help clear things up. However, if you indeed didn’t get the position, then simply accept it and continue applying for jobs. Remember, every rejection is an opportunity to practice your interviewing skills.
