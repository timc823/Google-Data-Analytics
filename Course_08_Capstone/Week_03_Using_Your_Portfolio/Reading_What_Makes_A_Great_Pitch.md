# What makes a great pitch

![img](img/pitch1.png)

There is a certain question that you will probably be asked throughout your career, especially during professional interviews: “Tell me about yourself?” This can be tricky to answer well, but the goal is to positively and accurately represent yourself using your past and present experiences and skills–essentially, you need to pitch yourself. In this reading, you will learn how to promote yourself as an effective and highly skilled data analyst in a job interview. Even if you don’t have any professional data analysis work on your resume yet, experience and skills you gained from previous work of any kind can be useful to share if you pitch it the right way. 

To help you prepare, here are some possible questions you might be asked in an interview, including technical questions to assess specific practical knowledge and questions that require you to apply your own personal experiences.

## Technical questions

* “What are your preferred tools for analysis?”  This is a chance to demonstrate that you are well-versed in data analysis, with proficiency in SQL, Excel, and R programming.
* “How do you maintain integrity in your data?”  Reliability and accuracy are essential parts of good data analysis, and any issues with your data can have a major impact on data-driven business decisions. Be prepared to discuss the methods you use for error checking and validation.
* “Do you understand different SQL functions and the roles they play?”  SQL is arguably one of the most important skills for you to have as a data analyst. This is an opportunity to demonstrate your understanding of different types of SQL functions and their value or result.

## Personal experience questions

* “Was there a time when you took initiative during a project and what was the outcome?” This question can come in many forms with slightly different wording, but the goal is to understand your leadership abilities and how you have used them in the past. 
* “What was the most challenging project you have ever been faced with?” This question is usually meant to assess your problem-solving and interpersonal skills. Come to the interview prepared with several different examples of how you successfully navigated a difficult project or situation in the past. 
* “How would you explain a complex topic to a stakeholder who was unfamiliar with it?” This question helps your interviewer get a sense of how skilled you are at communicating effectively in high-pressure or sensitive circumstances.
* “How do you cope when things don’t go according to plan?” It is important to be adaptable, especially when things don’t go the way you expected. This question provides a great opportunity for you to explain how you coped with unexpected changes and adapted quickly to a different course of action.

Try crafting answers to each of these questions and coming up with fitting examples for each scenario. Write the answers down and practice them until they feel natural and unrehearsed.

## Prepare yourself
There is no way for you to know exactly what your interviewer will ask you. But preparing some polished and professional answers to common interview questions can be incredibly helpful. Learning how to successfully pitch yourself and your skills as a data analyst takes practice. The more you practice, the more comfortable you will likely be during the actual interview, regardless of what questions you get asked.
